How to Entangle Craytons
------------------------

A tutorial on how to write a program that does the same thing as a
two-channel Bell test experiment, except with variables in a digital
computer, rather than with particles in a laboratory apparatus,
quantum computers, etc. The tutorial is written in CWEB
(https://ctan.org/pkg/cweb), and is itself a ‘literate C’ example of
such a program.

You can read about two-channel Bell test experiments here:

The text of the tutorial also contains a very simple--and perhaps
novel--proof of the correlation coefficient of two-channel Bell tests.
